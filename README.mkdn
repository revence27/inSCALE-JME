inSCALE, the App
================
With this application, one fetches (automatically) the menu items that prompt for, clean, store, and submit the data that the inSCALE project needs.

The workings of it are generally on an opcode system; the opcodes may get shorter and even perhaps singly-byte, to speed up download speeds (although, since that has not yet been a problem, that has not been implemented yet).
